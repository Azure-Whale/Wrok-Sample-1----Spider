# Working-Sample-1----E-commerce Spider

This is a small code sample of my most recent work. It is just a reference of how I write my code in working environment.

The spider will crawl all the items on sephora automatically through selenium and scrapy, then deliver the data to the AWS RDS and DynamoDB.
