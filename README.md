# E-commerce Spider

This is a small code sample of my most recent work. It is just a reference of how I write my code in working environment.

The spider will crawl all the items on sephora automatically through selenium and scrapy, then deliver the data to the AWS RDS and DynamoDB.

To see how it works in our product, you may go to our website and take a look: https://busysquirrels.com/?category=Sephora
